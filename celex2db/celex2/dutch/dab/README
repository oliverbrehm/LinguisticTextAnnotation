The field marked with "Dia" may contain diacritics of various kinds.
These diacritics have been coded as a sequence of two ASCII symbols,
a diacritic marker followed by the hosting letter. The degree sign,
however, is NOT associated with a particular letter. The following
conventions have been used:

  diacritic symbol           diacritic sign

	@                    (degree sign, can't be shown in standard ASCII)
	"                           "        (diaeresis)
