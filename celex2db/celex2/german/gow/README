GERMAN ORTHOGRAPHY, WORDFORMS


The gow.cd file contains the following fields:

   1.    IdNum
   2.    WordDia
   3.    Mann
   4.    IdNumLemma
   5.    WordSylDia
   6.    WordSylChg

The fields marked with "Dia" may contain diacritics of various kinds.
These diacritics have been coded as a sequence of two ASCII symbols, a
diacritic marker followed by the hosting letter. The Eszett, however,
is represented by a single dollar sign. The following conventions have
been used:

  diacritic symbol           diacritic sign
        #                           '       (acute accent)
        "                           "       (diaeresis (Umlaut))
        $                           ss      (Eszett)

The awk directory contains the following scripts:

   script CountCharacters(String):        countchr.awk
   script CountSyllables(String):         countsyl.awk
   script ReverseString(String):          reverse.awk
   script SortString(String):             sortstr.awk
   script StripDiacritics(String):        stripdia.awk
   script ToLower(String):                tolower.awk

These scripts may be used to obtain those columns listed in the CELEX
User Guide that do not appear in the above list, as follows:
